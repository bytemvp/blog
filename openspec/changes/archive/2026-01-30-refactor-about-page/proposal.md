## Why

The current about page is a long-form block of placeholder text with limited structure, which feels dated and makes it harder for readers to learn who the author is. A modern, sectioned layout will improve clarity, credibility, and engagement.

## What Changes

- Redesign the about page into structured sections (hero bio, story, values, timeline, skills, contact)
- Improve typography and visual hierarchy for readability
- Replace placeholder content with clear section scaffolding
- Ensure the new layout is responsive and visually polished
