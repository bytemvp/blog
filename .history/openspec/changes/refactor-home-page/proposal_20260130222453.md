## Why

The current home page lacks a modern, high-impact layout, which makes the site feel dated and reduces engagement. A full redesign will improve visual polish, highlight key content, and align the home page with contemporary blog standards.

## What Changes

- Redesign the home page layout with modern sections and hierarchy (hero, featured posts, highlights, CTAs)
- Introduce a more visually engaging layout and typography system
- Add a featured content area and a clear primary call-to-action
- Improve responsiveness and spacing for a polished, popular-blog aesthetic

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `home-page-layout`: Modern home page sections and layout structure
- `home-page-featured-content`: Featured posts/sections and content spotlighting on the home page
- `home-page-cta`: Primary call-to-action section and placement

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- No existing capabilities are being modified -->

## Impact

- **Affected Pages**: Home page at `src/pages/index.astro`
- **Affected Styles**: Global styles and any home-specific styling
- **Components**: May introduce new home page sections or reusable UI components
